# About the Guide

Hi, I am an ambivert, creative, thinker, father, husband of generation X from Kolkata, India enjoying the creative and emotional challenges of life. 

I have been working in Indian IT industry over 25 years and have worked for many Global MNC's for their IT solutions. 

But over the years I have been asked by many of friends, colleagues, aspiring students about the best course to learn web design and development. 

I decided to arrange one and to help all aspiring persons to go through it and start learning web design and  development.
