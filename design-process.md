# Web Design Process

## Client Briefing

This is the initial discussion with client about his thoughts and intention of launching a website. In this briefing try to ask questions to identify client goals, purpose, budget, liking about his project.

## Planning /Quotation

Once you have the enough information from the client about the project and are in a position to gauge the requirements then start a rough plan to execute the  project and start estimating time and effort. This kind of quotation are mainly called **ballpark estimation** with little research.  

To provide a detail quotation with all the line items along with it you needs to little bit of more research before you can actually portray it in your quotation. Once you have filled up all the items you would be able to estimate the cost/efforts for the project and ready to send the Quotes to the client.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always mention the quotes may change if requirements get changed in later phase. And clearly mention the assumptions in the quotes. 
{% endhint %}

## Research

* Research for ballpark estimate should not takes more than 15-20 minutes
* Research for a proper estimate you must spend 1.5 hours to not more than 3 Hours
* Detail research or deep dive research needs more time and in this section we will discuss about this detail research and this is not time bound.

When doing _Details Research_ it is recommended to use **Mood Board** for the new project where you collect inspirations, concepts and ideas about the new project, basically you collect various ideas you think are related and could go well for the project. 

* Website design 
* Content
* Images
* Form design 
* Color pallet
* Competitor site

{% hint style="info" %}
[Pinterest.com](https://in.pinterest.com/) is good online tool to use as a **Mood Board**
{% endhint %}

## Brainstorming 

Simply use your Mood Board and your creative thinking to reach the purpose/goal of the web site as described by the client.

Tweak/Pivot as and when required to match the goal of the web site.

## Concept-Sketch/Wire-frame/Low Fidelity Design \(LFD\)

When your concepts are final and you think you can start wire framing to portray your concepts start making wire frames 

{% hint style="info" %}
Adobe Photoshop or Adobe XD are good tools to develop wire-frame or LFD
{% endhint %}

## High Fidelity Design \(HFD\)

When you are done with LFD/Wireframe and your client approves the wire frame start fleshing out the concept as HFD with images, texts, colors to gives a real life looks and in an iterative process get it approved from your client. 

## Development

When you client approves the HFD your design process ends and you enters to the next phase of the project which is Development of the HFD to make it functional and ready to host into the web server.
